## Steal the Diamond: a Python Create-Your-Own-Adventure (CYOA) Game! ðŸ’Ž

This a decision-based story game I coded in Python, with minigames spread throughout. Currently runs in the Python terminal (still working on a frontend)!

> **_NOTE:_** Inspired by Henry Stickmin's "Stealing the Diamond".

Tonight marks the first night of the country-wide Christmas holiday, and you can't be any happier. You are robbing the largest jewelry bank in the world, with a single diamond valued at $500,000. So, you decide to infiltrate the back, since it has the least amount of guards watching (you do not wear a mask). What choices will you make? Do you have what it takes to run away with the precious jewel?

**NOTE**
To make "CYOA-MUSIC.py" fully functional, make sure all of the 16 music files are in the "music" folder.

CYOA-MUSIC.py only works on Windows, so I've added a second one without music for players on different operating
systems (CYOA-NO Music.py)

## Future Plans:

- Build frontend
- Make music available cross-platform

Enjoy!
